<h1> This repository is to learn PHP, and git, to create active webpages. </h1>
<p> PHP (recursive acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely-used open source general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development and can be embedded into HTML. Git is a version control system (VCS) for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for source code management in software development, but it can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files.</p>
<h6> There are archives of some of latest tests. Learning PHP and GIT together help me learn both way faster, and improve my experience, because git is very usefull! </h6>
